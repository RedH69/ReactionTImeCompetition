# ReactionTImeCompetition
I created an Arduino project that tests both your competitiveness and reflexes. Two players face off to see who can press their button the fastest. It was a blast to build and code this project. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it!

The game is pretty self-explainatory. It starts as soon as you plug it in. A 3 second countdown will start accompanied by the puzzer beeps and the rgb flashing the 3 lights simmilar to a racing Traffic light. After that, there will be a little time when bothe of the teams' LEDs turn and and you, playying as your team, have to press the button in front of you. Yo'll know you won because the opponent's LED will turn off.

To reset the game, press the red arduino button on the board and start again.
