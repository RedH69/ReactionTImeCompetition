# ReactionTimeCompetition
I created an Arduino project that tests both your competitiveness and reflexes. Two players face off to see who can press their button the fastest. It was a blast to build and code this project. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it!

The game is pretty self-explanatory. It starts as soon as you plug it in. A 3-second countdown begins, accompanied by the buzzer beeps and the RGB flashing similar to a traffic light. When it turns white, both teams' LEDs light up and you, playing as your team, must press the button in front of you as fast as possible. You'll know you've won when the opponent's LED turns off.

To reset the game, press the red Arduino button on the board and start again.
